# YouTube Video Chat Application

This is a Gradio-based web application that allows users to interact with a YouTube video through chat. Users can input a YouTube URL and ask questions about the video's content, or simply ask questions without providing a URL. The application utilizes the Google Generative AI model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) to generate responses based on the video's transcript (if available) and the chat history.

## Features

- **YouTube Video Analysis**: Enter a YouTube URL to generate and analyze the video's transcript.
- **Contextual Question Answering**: Ask questions about the video's content or interact based on previous chat history.
- **Chat History Integration**: The application remembers previous interactions, allowing for more coherent and context-aware responses.
- **Optional YouTube URL**: If a YouTube URL is not provided, the application still answers based on user input and chat history.

## Installation

To get started with this application, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. Below are the steps to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `Python 3.x` installed. You'll also need `pip` to install the required packages.
